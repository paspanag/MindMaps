Mind Maps for FreeMind

I've been using FreeMind to take notes as I've realized lately that I've been relying on Google for information. These mind maps are great and can be searched very quickly.

I leave the most of the links of the sources I get the notes from in their respective nodes. I usually try to make small notes but most of the time the source is very clear and short that I usually just copy and paste.
